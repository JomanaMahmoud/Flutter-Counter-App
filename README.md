# Flutter Counter App

This is a simple counter application built using Flutter, developed with Android Studio. The app allows users to increment, decrement, and reset a counter value. When the counter reaches 10 clicks, a floating `SnackBar` notification is displayed.

## Features

- **Increment & Decrement**: Users can increment or decrement the counter by pressing the respective buttons.
- **Reset**: The counter can be reset to zero using the reset button.
- **Snackbar Notification**: A notification is shown when the counter reaches 10 clicks, with rounded edges and floating behavior.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
4. Open the project in Android Studio.

   ```

## How It Works

- The app contains three buttons: one to increment the counter, one to decrement it, and one to reset it to zero.
- If the counter reaches 10, a `SnackBar` with the message "You've reached 10 clicks!" is displayed for 2 seconds.
